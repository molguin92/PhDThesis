\section{Contributions of this thesis}

Here's where we ``present'' the papers.
However, we do this by presenting a ``red thread'' of contributions and key results.
Drive towards one big picture.

Add a hardened compilation of key results, conclusions, figures, and tables.
Synthesize and summarize the research questions and conclusions to find the red thread.

EdgeDroid (first demo paper at SEC, then HotMobile paper).

Tie in CLEAVE paper here as an extension of the approach towards other latency-sensitive applications.

Potentially include Ainur paper as a further extension of the methodology?

PLOS ONE paper as a stepping stone towards the final goal of a more realistic model?

Finally, EdgeDroid2 paper:
Presents the final model of human behavior
Applies it to a real optimization problem, employing theoretical results proved by Vishnu
