\textcite{munro2016aaremu}: Software framework for the emulation of AR on Android devices.
A trace of pre-recorded inputs (video, gyro, GPS) are replayed to the real processing code by mocking Android SDK APIS.
Recordings can be ``interactive'', in which case the trace corresponds to images indexed by directional bearings, i.e.\ a 3D sphere), or non-interactive, in which case the trace corresponds to a video replayed at a customizable framerate.

\subsection{Testbed research in Edge Computing}

\todo[inline]{Needs harmonizing.}

The last few years have seen the emergence of a number of small- to mid-scale platforms and testbeds for edge computing research.
Several of these are additionally driven by research interests in novel mobile networking technologies and \gls{MEC}, as well as in the virtualization of network functions.
Of particular interest to us are the
\begin{inlineenum}
    \item \acs{GENI}
    \item Chameleon
    \item \acs{COSMOS}
    \item \acs{POWDER}
    \item \acs{ARA}
    \item EdgeNet
%    \item Drexel Grid \gls{SDR}
\end{inlineenum} testbeds.

\gls{GENI} is a testbed deployed across more than fifty sites across the \gls{USA}.
Originally designed for ``the development, deployment, and validation of transformative, at-scale concepts in network science, services, and security''~\cite{berman2014geni}, \gls{GENI} today combines local edge compute resources with mobile network last-hop connectivity for \gls{MEC} experimentation~\cite{gosain2017geni}.
The wireless-capable sites incorporate single-hop access to compute, storage, and network resource, making \gls{GENI} a compelling edge computing platform.

The Chameleon testbed is a research platform originally designed for the study and evaluation of cloud computing systems~\cite{keahey2020lessons}, but which has recently been expanded to target edge computing research through the \acs{CHI}@Edge project.
Chameleon is a collaborative project operated by a consortium of research institutions and industry partners, and is designed to provide a flexible and reconfigurable infrastructure for researchers to experiment with and test various cloud computing technologies, algorithms, and configurations.
The testbed provides a highly reconfigurable array of hardware and software resources, including servers, storage systems, and networking equipment, able to simulate various cloud and edge computing scenarios.

\gls{COSMOS} is a testbed deployed in New York City (State of New York, \gls{USA}), containing over \num{200} rooftop, intermediate, and mobile nodes.
The testbeds main \emph{raison d'Ãªtre} is \gls{MEC} research, with a strong emphasis on wireless networks.
The system includes \glspl{SDR}, \si{\milli\meter}-wave equipment, optical fibers, cloud integration, and edge compute for core network functionality and application data processing~\cite{yu2019cosmos,raychaudhuri2020challenge}.

\gls{POWDER} is described by the authors of~\cite{breen2020powder} as a ``city-scale, remotely accessible, end-to-end software defined platform supporting a broad range of wireless and mobile related research''.
It features roughly \num{15} fixed programmable radio nodes, based on off-the-shelves \glspl{SDR}, distributed across a \SI{15}{\kilo\meter\squared} area in Salt Lake City (State of Utah, \gls{USA}).
These radio nodes are combined with edge-based compute nodes as well as cloud resources for full \gls{MEC} experimentation.

The \gls{ARA} platform~\cite{zhang2022ara} is a highly flexible testbed based on the \gls{CHI} software suite originally developed for the aforementioned Chameleon testbed~\cite{keahey2020lessons}.
\gls{ARA} is developed by researchers at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa (\gls{USA}), and spans a rural area with a diameter of over \SI{60}{\kilo\meter}~\cite{zhang2022ara}.
Its core goal is the study and deployment of advanced edge computing and wireless platforms and technologies in real-world agricultural and rural settings, and includes a broad range of wireless technologies deployed through both \glspl{SDR} and programmable \gls{COTS} radios, as well as automated ground vehicles, cameras and sensors.

EdgeNet deviates from the approaches described above and represents a fully software-based, massively distributed public platform for edge computing research~\cite{cappos2018edgenet,senel2021edgenet1,senel2021edgenet2}.
It consists of a public, modified and customized Kubernetes~\cite{kubernetes} cluster.
The EdgeNet software is available for anyone to download;
individuals and organizations can quickly deploy self-hosted edge nodes which are then made available to anyone using the platform.
The end result is a flexible and scalable global edge cloud simplifying research and prototype development in edge and cloud computing.
A similar, closely-related project is KubeEdge~\cite{xiong2018extend}, a software framework for extending Kubernetes clusters from the cloud to the edge.

Finally, a number of other, small-scale approaches also exist.
In~\cite{gedawy2016cumulus}, the authors propose Cumulus, a prototype testbed for edge compute offloading in \gls{IOT} with the explicit goal of providing a generic and heterogeneous platform for edge computing research.
The authors of~\cite{rimal2018experimental} propose an experimental testbed for two-tiered edge architectures in the context of \gls{FIWI} edge computing.
This testbed is then employed to validate wireless access and compute resource scheduling strategies in these systems.
In~\cite{yamanaka2021design}, the authors present an experimental edge computing testbed capable of determining the offload location of a workload based on desired latency parameters.
\cite{diao2019scalable} propose yet another Kubernetes-based testbed based for edge task offloading based on heterogeneous hardware including low-power single-board computers such as Raspberry Pis and Jetson Nanos.
Finally,\ \cite{moorthy2022cloudraft} proposes \gls{CLOUDRAFT}, a cloud-based framework for mobile network experimentation, with a focus on simplifying the management of testbed resources.
The goal of this project is to integrate, coordinate, share, and improve upon existing testbeds through a common interface.
