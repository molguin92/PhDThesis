- Do people show signals of arousal in physio responses to system latency?
- Are response to delays effect cognitively/emotionally mediated?
- Effects moderated by personality?

Put around the aim.

R1Q6:

Mention hypothesis w.r.t. the previous questions.

Continuous vs. discrete event.
Changes in the pace vs. complete disruption.

Neuriticism hypothesis.
