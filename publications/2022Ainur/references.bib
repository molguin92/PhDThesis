  abstract  = {As the number of cyber-physical systems rises, it becomes increasingly crucial to study Networked Control Systems (NCSs) combining control communication co-design. This nature of NCSs has led to task-specific approaches to research, creating a dearth of generalizable, repeatable, and scalable experimentation. Further, with the advent of edge computing solutions, it is of paramount importance to explore its relevance in such applications. In this work, we present CLEAVE, a novel, completely software-based framework for repeatable and scalable experimentation in edge native NCSs. Our approach is based on the emulation of physical plants communicating over a real network with software-based controllers. CLEAVE is designed and built for the edge, using Python3 and with full compatibility with industry-standard containerization solutions. Although designed for single-loop emulations, the flexibility afforded by the aforementioned characteristics allow our framework to be adapted to a multitude of complex scenarios.We validate CLEAVE using an initial implementation of an inverted pendulum NCS. Our results showcase the utility of the tool as a repeatable, extensible, and scalable solution to NCS performance evaluation and benchmarking on the Edge.},

abstract = {OpenAirInterfaceTM (OAI) is an open-source project that implements the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technology on general purpose x86 computing hardware and Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software Defined Radio (SDR) cards like the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). It makes it possible to deploy and operate a 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network today and 5G New Radio (NR) networks in the future at a very low cost. Moreover, the open-source code can be adapted to different use cases and deployment and new functionality can be implemented, making it an ideal platform for both industrial and academic research. The OAI Software Alliance (OSA) is a non-profit consortium fostering a community of industrial as well as research contributors. It also developed the OAI public license which is an open source license that allows contributors to implement their own patented technology without having to relinquish their intellectual property rights. This new clause is in agreement with the Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) clause found in 3GPP. This paper describes the current OAI state-of-the-art of the development, the OAI community and development process, as well as the OAI public license and its usage by academia and industry.}
